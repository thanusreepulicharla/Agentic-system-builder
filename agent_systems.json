This logic would be implemented in the backend API.\n\n```python\n# Simulate a database query result for tasks\nsample_tasks_data = [\n    {\"id\": 1, \"title\": \"Setup project environment\", \"status\": \"Done\", \"assigned_to\": \"Alice\"},\n    {\"id\": 2, \"title\": \"Design database schema\", \"status\": \"In Progress\", \"assigned_to\": \"Bob\"},\n    {\"id\": 3, \"title\": \"Implement user authentication\", \"status\": \"To Do\", \"assigned_to\": \"Alice\"},\n    {\"id\": 4, \"title\": \"Develop task creation API\", \"status\": \"Done\", \"assigned_to\": \"Charlie\"},\n    {\"id\": 5, \"title\": \"Create frontend login page\", \"status\": \"In Progress\", \"assigned_to\": \"Bob\"},\n    {\"id\": 6, \"title\": \"Write unit tests for auth\", \"status\": \"To Do\", \"assigned_to\": \"Alice\"},\n    {\"id\": 7, \"title\": \"Refactor task list component\", \"status\": \"Blocked\", \"assigned_to\": \"Charlie\"},\n]\n\ndef calculate_team_progress(tasks):\n    total_tasks = len(tasks)\n    completed_tasks = sum(1 for task in tasks if task[\"status\"] == \"Done\")\n    in_progress_tasks = sum(1 for task in tasks if task[\"status\"] == \"In Progress\")\n    to_do_tasks = sum(1 for task in tasks if task[\"status\"] == \"To Do\")\n    blocked_tasks = sum(1 for task in tasks if task[\"status\"] == \"Blocked\")\n\n    percentage_completed = (completed_tasks / total_tasks * 100) if total_tasks > 0 else 0\n\n    return {\n        \"total_tasks\": total_tasks,\n        \"completed_tasks\": completed_tasks,\n        \"in_progress_tasks\": in_progress_tasks,\n        \"to_do_tasks\": to_do_tasks,\n        \"blocked_tasks\": blocked_tasks,\n        \"percentage_completed\": round(percentage_completed, 2)\n    }\n\nteam_summary = calculate_team_progress(sample_tasks_data)\nprint(\"Team Progress Summary:\")\nprint(f\"Total Tasks: {team_summary['total_tasks']}\")\nprint(f\"Completed Tasks: {team_summary['completed_tasks']}\")\nprint(f\"In Progress Tasks: {team_summary['in_progress_tasks']}\")\nprint(f\"To Do Tasks: {team_summary['to_do_tasks']}\")\nprint(f\"Blocked Tasks: {team_summary['blocked_tasks']}\")\nprint(f\"Percentage Completed: {team_summary['percentage_completed']}%\")\n```\n```output\nTeam Progress Summary:\nTotal Tasks: 7\nCompleted Tasks: 2\nIn Progress Tasks: 2\nTo Do Tasks: 2\nBlocked Tasks: 1\nPercentage Completed: 28.57%\n```\n\nThis Python code demonstrates the kind of data aggregation and calculation needed for the `DEV-DASH-003` technical task. The backend API would query the actual database, retrieve task data, and then perform similar calculations before sending the summary to the frontend.\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 4: Hand-off to Developer**\n\n**To the Developer:**\n\nHere is the prioritized list of technical tasks for the **Team Task Management Web Application MVP**.\n\n**Project Goal:** Deliver a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for a web-based task management system for small teams, focusing on core task creation, assignment, status updates, and user authentication.\n\n**MVP Scope:**\nThe MVP will include:\n*   User registration, login, and logout.\n*   Role-based access control (Team Member vs. Team Lead).\n*   Ability to create, view, update, and delete tasks (deletion restricted to Team Leads).\n*   Ability to assign tasks to team members.\n*   A personal task list for each user.\n*   A basic team progress summary for Team Leads.\n\n**Prioritization Key:**\n*   **P1 (Must-have for MVP):** Essential for the system to be functional and usable by the pilot team.

Let me know if you have any questions regarding the scope, specific requirements, or technical feasibility. Once we're aligned, you can begin development, starting with the P1 tasks. We'll schedule regular check-ins to review progress and address any blockers."

Here's a Python snippet demonstrating how we might process sample order data to validate structure or derive insights.\n\n```python\n# Simulate order data structure for validation/calculation\nsample_orders = [\n    {\n        \"order_id\": \"ORD001\",\n        \"order_date\": \"2023-10-26\",\n        \"total_amount\": 150.75,\n        \"current_status\": \"Shipped\",\n        \"items\": [\n            {\"product_name\": \"Laptop\", \"quantity\": 1, \"unit_price\": 1200.00},\n            {\"product_name\": \"Mouse\", \"quantity\": 1, \"unit_price\": 25.75}\n        ],\n        \"status_history\": [\n            {\"timestamp\": \"2023-10-26T10:00:00Z\", \"status\": \"Processing\"},\n            {\"timestamp\": \"2023-10-26T14:30:00Z\", \"status\": \"Shipped\"}\n        ]\n    },\n    {\n        \"order_id\": \"ORD002\",\n        \"order_date\": \"2023-10-25\",\n        \"total_amount\": 45.00,\n        \"current_status\": \"Delivered\",\n        \"items\": [\n            {\"product_name\": \"Keyboard\", \"quantity\": 1, \"unit_price\": 45.00}\n        ],\n        \"status_history\": [\n            {\"timestamp\": \"2023-10-25T09:00:00Z\", \"status\": \"Processing\"},\n            {\"timestamp\": \"2023-10-25T12:00:00Z\", \"status\": \"Shipped\"},\n            {\"timestamp\": \"2023-10-26T11:00:00Z\", \"status\": \"Delivered\"}\n        ]\n    },\n    {\n        \"order_id\": \"ORD003\",\n        \"order_date\": \"2023-10-27\",\n        \"total_amount\": 25.50,\n        \"current_status\": \"Processing\",\n        \"items\": [\n            {\"product_name\": \"USB Cable\", \"quantity\": 2, \"unit_price\": 10.00},\n            {\"product_name\": \"Adapter\", \"quantity\": 1, \"unit_price\": 5.50}\n        ],\n        \"status_history\": [\n            {\"timestamp\": \"2023-10-27T08:00:00Z\", \"status\": \"Processing\"}\n        ]\n    }\n]\n\n# Calculate total items across all sample orders\ntotal_items_across_all_orders = 0\nfor order in sample_orders:\n    for item in order.get(\"items\", []):\n        total_items_across_all_orders += item.get(\"quantity\", 0)\n\nprint(f\"Total items across all sample orders: {total_items_across_all_orders}\")\n\n# Validate that all orders have a 'current_status' and 'status_history'\nall_statuses_present = all(\"current_status\" in order and \"status_history\" in order for order in sample_orders)\nprint(f\"All orders have 'current_status' and 'status_history': {all_statuses_present}\")\n\n# Identify unique statuses observed in current_status\nunique_current_statuses = set(order[\"current_status\"] for order in sample_orders if \"current_status\" in order)\nprint(f\"Unique current order statuses found: {list(unique_current_statuses)}\")\n\n# Identify all unique statuses across all status histories\nall_historical_statuses = set()\nfor order in sample_orders:\n    for status_entry in order.get(\"status_history\", []):\n        all_historical_statuses.add(status_entry.get(\"status\"))\nprint(f\"All unique historical statuses found: {list(all_historical_statuses)}\")\n```\n```output\nTotal items across all sample orders: 6\nAll orders have 'current_status' and 'status_history': True\nUnique current order statuses found: ['Shipped', 'Delivered', 'Processing']\nAll unique historical statuses found: ['Processing', 'Shipped', 'Delivered']\n```\n---\n\n**Developer Hand-off Summary:**\n\nThe tasks are laid out in a phased approach, starting with the core MVP functionality (P1) and progressing to enhancements (P2) and optimizations/advanced features (P3). Please begin with the P1 tasks, ensuring the backend APIs are stable before the frontend development heavily relies on them.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions or require further clarification on any of these tasks."
